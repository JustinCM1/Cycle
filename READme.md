1. TRON
This is a very basic game of tron in C# where two players try and cut off the other one to win the game. 

2. Just have the latest verison of the C# extension on Visual Studio Code. And whenever you're ready to play, create a new terminal and type in "dotnet build" followed
"dotnet run" and you should be good to go!
